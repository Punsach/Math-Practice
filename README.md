Our creative project is to create a website that allows users to practice answering different types of test questions. The questions would be stored in a database, and we would rank them by difficulty. The user can filter what type of questions they get based on difficulty/subject. The questions will each be worth certain points, and the website will keep track of the points the user has. Additionally, there will be leaderboards to rank users by how many points they have.
